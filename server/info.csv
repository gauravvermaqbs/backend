matter.jpg,"Matter is made up of particles: atoms, molecules or ions. Matter occupies a volume in space. Matter has a mass. Matter particles are in constant motion.",A flowchart listing the characteristics of matter.
matter_chart.jpg,"Matter is defined as any substance that occupies space and has mass. A pure substance has a definite and uniform chemical composition. A mixture is a combination of two or more pure substances that retain their individual properties. A pure substance can be either an element or a compound. An element is composed of one kind of atom, for example magnesium (MG) and sulfur (S). A compound is composed of two or more kinds of atoms in a fixed ratio, for example magnesium sulfide (MG S) or water (H2 O). A mixture can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous mixture has a uniform composition and properties throughout, for example sea water or a metal alloy. A heterogeneous mixture has a non-uniform composition and varying properties, for example paint or salad dressing. ","A flowchart showing how matter is classified into either a pure substance or a mixture, with examples."
